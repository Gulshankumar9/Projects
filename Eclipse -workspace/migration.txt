for struts2-core 6.3.02 version 

1.The import org.apache.struts2.interceptor.servletrequestaware is deprecated in Struts 6.x.x1. You should use ServletRequestAware.withServletRequest(HttpServletRequest) instead of setServletRequest(HttpServletRequest)
use import : import org.apache.struts2.action.ServletRequestAware;

You can also use the ConversionErrorInterceptor to add the conversion errors to the actionâ€™s field errors automatically



4.According to the Struts documentation1, the getName() method is not removed in the higher version, but it is public and should be accessed from the ActionContext object. This method returns the name of the current action2. You can also use the ServletActionContext.getActionMapping().getName()
